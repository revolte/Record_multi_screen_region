# Record_multi_screen_region
This script is an application built using PyQt5, OpenCV, and pyautogui that allows the user to record a selected region of the screen.

Let's go through the script step by step:

The necessary imports are made:

sys for system-level operations
numpy as np for numerical operations
cv2 for image and video processing using OpenCV
pyautogui for capturing screenshots
QApplication, QWidget, QVBoxLayout, QDesktopWidget, QPushButton from PyQt5 for creating the application window and buttons
Qt, QPoint, QRect, QTimer from PyQt5.QtCore for handling events and timers
QPixmap, QPainter, QPen, QColor from PyQt5.QtGui for painting on the application window
QtGui from PyQt5.uic.properties (unused in the script)
The MyApp class is defined, which inherits from QWidget class, representing the main application window.

In the __init__ method of the MyApp class:

The screen size is obtained using QDesktopWidget() and stored in screen_width and screen_height variables.
The minimum size of the application window is set to the screen size.
Window flags are set to create a frameless window that stays on top of other windows.
The window opacity is set to 0.5.
A vertical layout is created for the application window.
A QPixmap object is created with the size of the window and filled with white color.
QPoint objects begin and destination are initialized.
Three buttons, namely "Minimize," "Close," and "Record," are created and added to the layout. The buttons are styled with different colors and font sizes.
Signal-slot connections are established for the minimize button (to minimize the window), the close button (to close the application), and the record button (to toggle recording).
The paintEvent method is overridden to handle the painting on the application window:

A QPainter object is created with the application window as the target.
The QPixmap object is drawn on the painter.
For each region in the regions list, a blue rectangle is drawn using the painter.
If the begin and destination points are not null, a rectangle is drawn using those points.
The update method is called to refresh the window.
Event handling methods are overridden to capture mouse events:

In the mousePressEvent, when the left mouse button is pressed, the begin point is set to the event position, and the destination point is also set to the begin point. The window is updated.
In the mouseMoveEvent, when the left mouse button is moved, the destination point is updated to the current mouse position. The window is updated.
In the mouseReleaseEvent, when the left mouse button is released, a rectangle is created using the begin and destination points, normalized, and added to the regions list. The rectangle is also drawn on the QPixmap object. The begin and destination points are reset, and the window is updated.
The toggle_recording method is defined to start or stop the recording:

If the application is not currently recording (is_recording is False), the `start_rec
